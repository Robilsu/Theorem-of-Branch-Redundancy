To run this project, first go to:
  https://github.com/Robilsu/Theorem-of-Branch-Redundancy/blob/main/BRANCH[WEB].lean
  
Load BRANCH[WEB].lean at (you can either copy-and-paste it or use the load function):
  https://leanprover-community.github.io/lean-web-editor
  
The Lean web editor will take some minutes to load fully and process the code.
Do not worry! The waiting is normal and happens only once (when the code is loaded).
